Project Risk Return Analysis:
    This is a Risk return analysis of SOROS FUND MANAGEMENT LLC, PAULSON & CO.INC., TIGER GLOBAL MANAGEMENT LLC, BERKSHIRE HATHAWAY INC, and S&P 500. This   
    analyzation encompasses the years 2014-2020. This analyzation gives us an over view of performance, volatility, risk, and risk-return profile.

    - [pandas](Data analysis in Python with pandas/toc.txt) - For data analysis and manipulation.

    - pathlib - For interacting with file systems easier.

    - [%matplotlib](https://github.com/matplotlib/matplotlib.git) - Creating static, animated, and interactive visualizations in Python.
    
    - [Numpy](https://github.com/numpy/numpy.git) - To perform mathematical operations.


Installation Guide:
    Before running the application first install the following dependencies.

    - import pandas as pd
    - from pathlib import Path
    - %matplotlib inline
    - import numpy as np
